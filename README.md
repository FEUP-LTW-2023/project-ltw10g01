All users should be able to (users can simultaneously be clients and agents):
- Register a new account.
- Login and Logout.
- Edit their profile (at least name, username, password, and e-mail).

Clients should be able to:
- Submit a new ticket optionally choosing a department (e.g., "Accounting").
- List and track tickets they have submitted.
- Reply to inquiries (e.g., the agent asks for more details) about their tickets and add more information to already submitted tickets.

Agents should be able to (they are also clients):
- List tickets from their departments (e.g., "Accounting"), and filter them in different ways (e.g., by date, by assigned agent, by status, by priority, by hashtag).
- Change the department of a ticket (e.g., the client chose the wrong department).
- Assign a ticket to themselves or someone else.
- Change the status of a ticket. Tickets can have many statuses (e.g., open, assigned, closed); some may change automatically (e.g., ticket changes to "assigned" - after being assigned to an agent).
- Edit ticket hashtags easily (just type hashtag to add (with autocomplete), and click to remove).
- List all changes done to a ticket (e.g., status changes, assignments, edits).
- Manage the FAQ and use an answer from the FAQ to answer a ticket.

Admins should be able to (they are also agents):
- Upgrade a client to an agent or an admin.
- Add new departments, statuses, and other relevant entities.
- Assign agents to departments.
- Control the whole system.

Some suggested additional requirements. These requirements are a way of making sure each project is unique. You do not have to implement all of these:
- Tickets can have documents attached to them (both by clients and agents).
- Admins should be able to see key performance indicators and other statistics (e.g., number of tickets closed by agent, number of open tickets per day).
- Agents can belong to more than one department.
- Agents can see a client's history.
- Agents can watch tickets not assigned to them (e.g., when transferring a ticket, the agent can check a box stating that he still wants to follow the ticket).
- Tickets can be merged together or marked as duplicates from another ticket.
- Tickets can have to-do lists that must be completed before the ticket is closed.
- Tasks can also be assigned to agents.
